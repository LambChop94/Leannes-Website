      <h2 class="featurette-heading"><img src="images/LeannesLogo.png" style="width: 5%; height: 5%;"> About Me <img src="images/LeannesLogo.png" style="width: 5%; height: 5%;"></h2>
      <p class="mainText">I am a fourth year Honours Political Science student, I have studied at McMaster for three of my four years. Throughout my time at this school I have been able to pursue many different areas of interest through extracurriculars. I have joined the quidditch team, held a seat on the First Year Council, am the president of a club, and have participated as a rep in Welcome Week for three years. I've discovered more about who I am as a person and where my interests and passions lie. From my first visit to McMaster before accepting my offer of admission, I was struck by the community on campus and the incredible sense of home. This is a feeling that I have carried with me throughout my undergrad and ultimately which has led me to genuinely care about what happens on campus. My decision to run for president stems from this, and has been integral in developing a platform centered around students and our community.</p>

      <p class="mainText">I have approached the points on my platform from the perspective of students, and what kind of change we would want to see. To accomplish this I have conducted research with many different student groups on campus to see where their interests and concerns lie, so that I can better address them. This approach to developing a platform is important, as it encourages student involvement and listens to student's opinions from the outset. Rather than deciding the changes that should be made and imposing them on groups.</p>

    <h2>Breaking Down Accessibility Barriers</h2>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 class="headlines">Counselling</h3>
      <p class="mainText">For students to have access to a counselor they must book a month in advance, making them lucky if they get in to see their counselor once a month. This level of support from the university is not acceptable. Post-secondary schooling is mentally, physically and emotionally exhausting for students. This service is in place to provide support and encouragement, yet due to the overwhelming demand that they are under, counsellors are not able to provide the level of support that students need. This is an issue that needs to be resolved. The university has committed to constructing a positive conversation around mental health and mental illnesses, however the services that are provided have not been addressed to meet this shift. We need to increase the availability of counselling services on campus, through providing a better mental health clinic making use of the proposed new space if it passes. Looking into the surplus from the health insurance fund and the allocation of funds to hiring counselling support, to ensure that students receive the level of support and aid from the wellness centre that they may require.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"> 
      <h3 class="headlines">Wheelchair Accessible Seating</h3>
      <p class="mainText">Individuals with accessibility needs face many challenges everyday. The services that are in place to assist them need to be functioning at the highest level to prevent impeding these students in their mobility, ease of access and general learning atmosphere. To address this, simple maintenance on the automatic doors and elevators already in place can help to make mobility less of a concern for students. As will ensuring that ramps are cleared of snow and leaves during the different seasons. Further, ensuring that lecture halls are equipped with wheelchair accessible desk space, and in those lecture halls where this is not the case, taking the necessary steps to ensure that this desk space is provided.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 class="headlines">Podcasting and Microphones</h3>
      <p class="mainText">Any student in a large lecture hall should be able to hear and understand the professor at all times. To ensure this, microphones should be worn by the professors specifically in lecture halls with more than 100. This encourages a better learning situation for the students and an easier teaching environment for professors, as they are able to communicate the information effectively. Further, for students requiring additional support from SAS, as the professor is already using a microphone for the lecture, podcasting is not as large of an issue. Further, with the podcasts provided through SAS, only those students who need them will have access to the podcasted information, if the professor so desires. This system will not infringe on courses that have podcasts provided already, but seeks to aid student learning in courses where podcasts are not already available to them.</p>

  <h2 class="headlines">Breaking Down Integration Barriers</h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 class="headlines">Faculty Societies</h3>
      <p class="mainText">The McMaster Student Union has been scrutinized in the past as operating within a 'bubble'. This concern was addressed by the current president, Justin Monaco-Barnes in his platform. Building on this concept of reaching outside of the current bubble to attract more student involvement in MSU driven events and opportunities, we seek to make the MSU more open. Achieving this includes the use of faculty societies and further collaboration with SRA members to ensure that  updates and information is made accessible to the student body. Providing information regarding events being held in other faculties, as well as the goals, actions and events of the MSU. Further, more information regarding the necessary steps that must be taken for students to campaign for any position within the MSU should be made readily available and easy to access on the MSU website.</p>

      <p class="mainText">McMaster University has 6 different faculties, and many, many more programs. Each program differs from each other, and their societies hold events for their own members.  The push for collaboration on events hosted by faculties and students encourages these societies to facilitate networking outside of a specific faculty or program. That is not to say that the development of faculty or program specific events and community is an issue, but rather that alongside this opportunity, work can be done to forge connections between programs and faculties. The introduction and integration of events hosted by a collaboration of faculties allows students to make connections between different disciplines and allows them to network with their peers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"> 
      <h3 class="headlines">Welcome Week and Mentorship</h3>
      <p class="mainText">Currently not all faculties have mentorship programs that offer their students the necessary service of peer to peer support. Seeking to collaborate with the different student initiative such as Faculty society driven programs, and MSU services such as MSU Spark, directed towards peer mentoring. Working with the systems already in place for the creation of a program or working group that facilitates the operation of faculty based mentorship programs, would help with several different aspects of student life. For incoming first years this program can aid in the transition to McMaster University through offering academic and social support. This will be achieved through one-on-one or small group mentoring with first years and upper years in their program, providing them with information about courses, professors, and the program in general. As well as helping students to build connections at events held for all mentors and mentees within a program, and the broader community as well. For programs that specify their majors after first year, second years can be offered support when they enter into their specific major or area by students mentors who are currently in those programs. The connections that they have already made in first year continue into their upper years, with mentors able to offer more specific support as mentees specialize, as well as working to expand this program by reaching out to faculty members and alumnus from programs to work with the second year students.</p>
      
      <p class="mainText">During Welcome Week there would be advertising for these services, culminating in the addition of a second faculty day at the end of the week. This day would be set up to connect first year students with mentors from their faculty and program, to allow them to begin building relationships. The benefit to this is taking place at the end of Welcome Week and before classes begin, is to provide a transition period between Welcome Week and the beginning of studies for the students. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 class="headlines">Freedom Credit</h3>
      <p class="mainText">Currently, students are given a wide variety of courses to take as electives, many of these courses are outside of their faculty and major.  However, many students are reluctant to take courses outside of their program due to the concern that taking a course with content that is unfamiliar may negatively affect their GPA. Giving students that option to opt out of a percent grade in favor for a pass or fail grade, allows them to take courses out of their comfort zone. This allows students the opportunity to have a well rounded, interdisciplinary university career, along with the collaboration of different faculty societies on hosting events this opportunity further expands the community at McMaster and provides more options for networking and connecting with peers.</p>

  <h2 class="headlines">Breaking Down Community Barriers</h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 class="headlines">Student Space</h3>
      <p class="mainText">With 21,000 MSU members, there is a serious lack of space dedicated to students on campus. This point is addressed in the referendum put forward by the SRA. encouraging the creation or allocation of student oriented space on campus is important. There is currently no easily available space on campus for students that does not serve some other purpose.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"> 
      <h3 class="headlines">SOCS</h3>
      <p class="mainText">The Off-Campus Society represents the majority of undergraduate students and works to provide them with different community building events. To promote this goal, several steps can be taken. Establishing SOCS as a non-voting speaking member of the SRA, includes them in the decision making process of the Student Union. This can enable the organization to better speak to concerns of Off-Campus students that are not represented by the services and student organizations affiliated with the Student Union. Tying into the issues regarding lounge space on campus, aside from the SOCS office there is no space for Off-Campus students to gather as a community. The allocation of this space is meant for all undergraduate students, as at some point during our university careers we are all off-campus students. Further, steps can be taken to provide first year information sessions regarding housing, these sessions can be provided to on-campus first year students to aid them in finding student housing off-campus. These sessions would provide information regarding the Landlord Tenant Agreement and the rights of the students, as well as where to look for available housing and what to take into consideration when choosing a student house. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3 class="headlines">Groups and Clubs</h3>
      <p class="mainText">Currently many clubs and cultural groups have several issues regarding their operation as a student group on campus. One of the most prominent issues is the difficulty surrounding booking space for events on campus, the confusion surrounding the many different outlets through which to book space on campus; the McMaster Student Centre, the Conference & Event Services, Library websites. With larger spaces on campus requiring rental fees from student groups for the use of those rooms, including CIBC Hall, and space in the Athletic Centre. Streamlining this process for clubs, student groups, and individual students can greatly improve the operation of some clubs and their ability to host events for their members. A second area of concern for many groups is the issues regarding food on campus. The monopoly that Paradise Catering has on the food on campus means that cultural groups are unable to provide their members with traditional foods. The contract with Paradise stipulates that all catering in MUSC must be ordered through them, which greatly limits the options of food available to students to offer at their events. Even with the addition of TwelvEighty catering options, there is still a limit placed on the kind of food that can be offered on campus by student groups. As autonomous actors at McMaster, these clubs and student groups should have the ability to serve their members properly, and to provide traditional food options.</p>
